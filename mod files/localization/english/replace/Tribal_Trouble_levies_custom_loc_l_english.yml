  # game_concept_vassal_desc:1 "A $game_concept_vassal$ is a [ruler|E] who has sworn fealty to another ruler — their [liege|E].\n\nThe $game_concept_vassal$ provides their liege with $levies_culture_player$ and [taxes|E] — their [obligations|E] — in exchange for protection.\n\nIf a $game_concept_vassal$'s [opinion|E] of their liege is low, they may join [factions|E], or [scheme|E] to replace their liege with someone else."
  # game_concept_recently_acquired_holding_desc:0 "[holdings|E] acquired in the last year that put a ruler above their [domain_limit|E] do not cause penalties to their other holdings, but also provide no [taxes|E] or $levies_culture_player$."
  # game_concept_vassal_obligations_desc:3 "$game_concept_vassal_obligations$ define how much [tax|E] and how many $levies_culture_player$ a [vassal|E] provides to their [liege|E]. The Vassal's [government_form|E] decides what the $game_concept_vassal_obligations$ are.\n\n#weak For example, Feudal Vassals have their $game_concept_vassal_obligations$ set by their [feudal_contract|E].#!\n\n[feudal] [vassals] pay a percentage of their total [taxes] and [levies] through the #high $feudal_government_taxes$#! and #high $feudal_government_levies$#! Obligations. #EMP These [modifier_contributions|E] can in turn be modified by 'fine print' options such as [GetVassalContractType( 'fortification_rights' ).GetObligationName( 'fortification_rights_granted' )] or [GetVassalContractType( 'special_contract' ).GetObligationName( 'special_contract_march' )].#!"
  # game_concept_disparate_tribes_tribal_authority_desc:0 "$game_concept_disparate_tribes$ is the lowest level of [tribal_authority|E]. At this level, [vassals|E] have no [opinion|E] penalty towards their [liege|E], and the liege lacks any power over them other than the ability to demand $levies_culture_player$ and [taxes|E]."
  # game_concept_vassal_limit_desc:2 "The $game_concept_vassal_limit$ determines how many [direct_vassals|E] you can legally have (excluding [barony|E]-tier vassals).\n\nAlthough you can go above your $game_concept_vassal_limit$, doing so will lower the [taxes|E] and $levies_culture_player$ your vassals provide, and you may be better off [transferring|E] some vassals to stay below the limit."
  # game_concept_leasing_desc:1 "Minor [baronies|E] can be $game_concept_leased$ out to [holy_orders|E] or [clergy|E]. Leased baronies provide [taxes|E] and $levies_culture_player$ to the [lessee|E] rather than the [holder|E].\n\nA holy order can lease [castle_holdings|E], while clergy can lease [temple_holdings|E].\n\nLeased [holdings|E] are still considered part of the holder's [realm|E]. [county_capitals|E] cannot be leased."
  # game_concept_realm_priest_desc:0 "A $game_concept_realm_priest$ is a [councillor|E] in charge of religious and spiritual affairs in [faiths|E] with the [GetFaithDoctrine('doctrine_theocracy_temporal').GetBaseName] [doctrine|E].\n\nUnlike their [GetFaithDoctrine('doctrine_theocracy_lay_clergy').GetBaseName] equivalent ([court_chaplains|E]), $game_concept_realm_priests$ automatically [lease|E] all [temple_holdings|E] in a [ruler|E]'s [domain|E], and also receive a portion of [taxes|E] and $levies_culture_player$ from [vassal|E] $game_concept_realm_priests$.\n\n$game_concept_realm_priests$ provide their [liege|E] with Levies and Taxes if they have a positive Opinion of them. The higher the [opinion|E] of their [liege|E], the more they will provide.\n\n$game_concept_realm_priests$ with a low Opinion of their Liege will not provide them with any Taxes or Levies, and might cause problems."
  # game_concept_capital_duchy_desc:0 "The $game_concept_capital_duchy$ Modifier increases the amount of $levies_culture_player$ you get out of all [holdings|E] you hold within the same [de_jure|E] [duchy|E] as your [capital|E]. For this modifier to be active, you need to personally hold the associated Duchy.\n\nThis modifier does not stack with Realm Capital bonus."
  # game_concept_rightful_liege_desc_part1:1 "The $game_concept_rightful_liege$ of a [vassal|E] is the [ruler|E] who holds the direct [de_jure|E] [liege|E] [title|E] of the $game_concept_vassal$'s [primary_title|E]. If a $game_concept_vassal$ is not under their $game_concept_rightful_liege$, they will contribute less [taxes|E] and $levies_culture_player$ as well as suffer an [opinion|E] penalty towards their $game_concept_liege$. Holding a higher-[title_tier|E] $game_concept_title$ of the same $game_concept_de_jure$ results in lessened penalties.\n\nAn exception to this is [duke|E]s that are part of an [empire|E]'s $game_concept_de_jure$ hierarchy and directly vassalized to their $game_concept_emperor$, which still contribute fully, exactly as if the $game_concept_emperor$ held their $game_concept_de_jure$ [kingdom|E] $game_concept_title$."
  # game_concept_regiment_desc:1 "A $game_concept_regiment$ is a group of [soldiers|E] of a single type (e.g., archers, footmen, or $levies_culture_player$). Although $game_concept_levies$ are organized into $game_concept_regiments$, the ones of real interest are the [men_at_arms|E]."
  # game_concept_holding_desc:0 "A $game_concept_holding$ is the central settlement of a [barony|E] or [county_capital|E].\n\nIt provides [taxes|E] and $levies_culture_player$ to its [holder|E], depending on its [holding_type|E]. The collection of Holdings personally owned by a [ruler|E] is called a [domain|E]."
  # game_concept_castle_holding_desc:0 "Castles are the most heavily fortified [holding_type|E] and the standard type for [feudal|E], [clan|E] and [tribal|E] [rulers|E], as well as [holy_orders|E]. They tend to provide more $levies_culture_player$ than [taxes|E]."
  # game_concept_temple_holding_desc:0 "Temples are a [holding_type|E] that can be held by members of the [clergy|E] as [church_property|E] (the [theocratic|E] [government_form|E]). However, in [faiths|E] with the [GetFaithDoctrine('doctrine_theocracy_lay_clergy').GetBaseName] [doctrine|E], anyone can hold Temples without penalty.\n\nTemples provide a fairly even mix of $levies_culture_player$ and [taxes|E]."
  # game_concept_tribal_holding_desc:0 "Tribes are poor in [taxes|E] but rich in $levies_culture_player$, [prestige|E], and [men_at_arms|E] upgrades. They have limited upgrade potential and, while strong early, quickly dwindle in power the longer time progresses. Only [tribal|E] characters can hold them without penalties.\n\nIf a Tribe exists in a [county|E], no other [holdings|E] can be built. [feudal|E] rulers will have to spend [gold|E] to transform Tribes into [castles|E]."
  # game_concept_city_holding_desc:1 "Cities are the wealthiest [holding_type|E], favoring [taxes|E] over $levies_culture_player$. They are associated with [republics|E], and holding them as any of the playable [government_forms|E] will always incur a penalty."
  # game_concept_rally_point_desc:0 "A $game_concept_rally_point$ is a mustering ground for the $levies_culture_player$ and [men_at_arms|E] under your command.\n\nIn times of [war|E], you can call up your [soldiers|E] at a Rally Point to gather an [army|E].\n\nThe Levies assigned to a Rally Point must come from either your own [domain|E] or your [vassals|E]. Rally Points can be reorganized, split and merged as you see fit."
  # game_concept_soldiers_desc:0 "$game_concept_soldiers$ is a collective term for the troops in a [regiment|E] or an [army|E], whether they are $levies_culture_player$ or [men_at_arms|E].\n\nHaving the most $game_concept_soldiers$ helps win [battles|E] and [sieges|E]."
  # game_concept_army_desc:1 "Armies are used to win [wars|E] by engaging in [battle|E] with other armies, and to [besiege|E] and [occupy|E] enemy [fortified_holdings|E]. Armies are raised in [rally_points|E] and primarily consist of $levies_culture_player$ and [men_at_arms|E], but can also be bolstered by [mercenaries|E] and [holy_orders|E].\n\nArmies can move across water by spending an amount of [gold|E] to secure transport. They can suffer losses from [attrition|E] if the local [barony|E] is unable to adequately [supply|E] them."
  # game_concept_feudal_desc:0 "Under the Feudal [government_form|E], a [liege|E] gives their [vassals|E] [land|E] to govern in exchange for $levies_culture_player$ and [taxes|E], regulated by individual [feudal_contracts|E] between Vassal and Liege."
  # game_concept_clan_desc:0 "Clans are a [government_form|E] in which the amount of $levies_culture_player$ and [taxes|E] given to a [liege|E] by their [vassals|E] is determined by their [opinion|E] of said Liege. However, the Liege's [crown_authority|E] can increase the minimum amount they must provide regardless of Opinion."
  # game_concept_republic_desc:1 "$game_concept_republic_government$ is an unplayable [government_form|E] where an elected citizen rules for life — the $game_concept_government_form$ of burghers and merchants.\n\n$game_concept_republican$ [vassals|E] have static [obligations|E] that cannot be changed, and thus always provide a dependable and predictable amount of $levies_culture_player$ and [taxes|E]."
  # game_concept_military_building_desc:0 "$game_concept_military_buildings$ are [buildings|E] whose primary function is to increase the number of $levies_culture_player$ they provide to their [holder|E]."
  # game_concept_men_at_arms_desc:0 "$game_concept_men_at_arms$ are professional [soldiers|E] superior to $levies_culture_player$.\n\nThe player has direct control over the composition and size of their Men-at-Arms [regiments|E].\n\nDifferent types of Men-at-Arms are good or bad in different types of [terrain|E]. Each type also [counters|E] another type."
  # game_concept_county_development_desc:0 "$game_concept_county_development$ is a measure of the local infrastructure and technological advancement in a [county|E]. \n\nHigher $game_concept_county_development$ increases the $levies_culture_player$, [taxes|E], and [supply_limit|E] gained from a $game_concept_county$."
  # game_concept_absolute_control_desc:1 "$game_concept_absolute_control$ is a special state of [control|E] enabled by the $absolute_control_perk_name$ [perk|E], denoting that the ruler has an iron grip over the population.\n\nWhenever $game_concept_control$ is at #V 100#!, it will instead display as '$ABSOLUTE_COUNTY_CONTROL$' and give additional bonuses to [taxes|E] and $levies_culture_player$."
  # game_concept_troop_quality_desc:0 "$game_concept_troop_quality$ gauges the power of an [army|E] relative to its number of [soldiers|E].\n\nAn $game_concept_army$ that only contains [knights|E] and [men_at_arms|E] will be of high $game_concept_troop_quality$ while an $game_concept_army$ containing a large number of $levies_culture_player$ will be of lower $game_concept_troop_quality$.\n\nThis means that a smaller $game_concept_army$ with a high $game_concept_troop_quality$ will punch well above their weight — carefully consider both the amount of Soldiers #Emphasis and#! $game_concept_troop_quality$ before engaging the enemy!"
  # game_concept_debt_desc:2 "Debt is state of having a negative amount of [gold_i][gold|E]. This typically happens when a [ruler|E] at war hires [mercenaries|E] without having enough Gold to cover the full cost, or when they are at war for too long.\n\n While in Debt you can not declare new [wars|E], your [men_at_arms|E] do not reinforce, and your enemies will have an [advantage|E] over you in battle. The deeper into debt you fall, the more penalties you will get — fewer $levies_culture_player$, reduced [county_opinion|E], and your [vassals|E] will like you less.\n\nIn addition to this, various other minor destabilizing events may occur, such as gaining [county_corruption|E] in your [domain|E] [counties|E]. \n\n#help It is generally a good idea to strike your enemies while they are in Debt, as they will fight with reduced [advantage|E]!#!"
